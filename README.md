## Pupose

The purpose of this application is to collect user input on the criteria they want their password to meet, and to output a string of characters meeting that criteria.

## Instructions

Upon clicking the **Generate Password** button, the application will prompt the user to answer a series of questions.

- Will lowercase characters be included in the password?
- Will uppercase characters be included in the password?
- Will numbers be included in the password?
- Will special characters be included in the password?
- How long will the password be? Length must be between 8 and 128 characters.

The resulting randomized string of characters will then be displayed in the text field. To generate another password, click the **Generate Password** button again and follow the onscreen prompts.
